Demo

To run the demo of serpint, follow these instructions.... 

Part one of the demo will show you the capability of serpint to control the GPIO pins over a serial port. Part 2 will also show you the same thing can be done over a network. The serial monitor that you run has NO GPIO library loaded, only a standard serial library.

For Part One You Will Need....

1. A Raspberry Pi with Screen and Keyboard
2. A way to check GPIO voltages (Voltmeter, LED)
3. Serpint (Download from http://github.com/602p/serpint)

For Part Two You Will need

1. Another computer (running linux)
2. A connection between them, on the same network
3. Serpint on the other computer

PART 1
This tests the GPIO control over serial functionality of serpint

                                    IN A TERMINAL
1. On your raspberry pi.... Cd to the bin directory of the serpint folder
2. Run
./serpint gpiotoserial ttyS44 4444
This will allow the GPIO pins to be controlled over the serial port ttyS44
NOTE: It will continue tring to connect UNTIL you do STEP 3! DO STEP 3 ASAP!
3. Open a new tab/tty and run the built-in serial monitor
./serpint monitor
4. In the monitor, enter your serial port as /dev/ttyS44
5. Attach a voltimeter or light to gpio pins 4 and ground [ see http://elinux.org/images/2/2a/GPIOs.png]
6. Press space in the monitor to toggle the power to pin 4
7. When done, press q to quit the monitor
8. Run 
./serpint cleanup

PART 2 [OPTIONAL]
This tests the networking functionality of serpint

1. On your raspberry pi.... Cd to the bin directory of the serpint folder
2. Run
./serpint gpiotoserial ttyS55 5555
This will allow the GPIO pins to be controlled over the serial port ttyS44
3. Run 
./serpint serialtosock ttyS55 5556
This will forward all traffic from the serial port ttyS55
NOTE: IT WILL SAY “WAITING FOR REMOTE CONNECTION”, DONT WORRY, THIS WILL GO AWAYIN STEP 6
4. Make note of your raspberry pi's IP address (you can find this out by doing 
sudo ifconfig|grep “inet addr” 
(you’ll want the top one)) You’ll need this in step 5
5. On another (linux) computer, download serpint
6. Cd to the bin folder and run 
./serpint socktoserial ttyS56 192.168.1.7 5556
You will want to replace 192.168.1.7 with the IP address that you got in step 3
This will make a serial port ttyS56, from the data sent when you started the code in step 3
NOTE: THE PROGRAM WILL EXIT. THIS IS NORMAL. IT STARTS A DAEMON AND EXITS
7. ON THE SECOND COMPUTER...Open a new tab/tty and run the built-in serial monitor
./serpint monitor
8. In the monitor, enter your serial port as /dev/ttyS56
9. Attach a voltimeter or light to gpio pins 4 and ground [ see http://elinux.org/images/2/2a/GPIOs.png]
10. Press space in the monitor to toggle the power to pin 4
11. When done, press q to quit the monitor
12. Run 
./serpint cleanup 
on bolth machines
